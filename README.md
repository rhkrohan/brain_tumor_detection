# Brain Tumor Detection
## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Brain tumors are critical medical conditions that require prompt and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional methods of detecting brain tumors through manual examination of MRI scans by radiologists are often time-consuming, prone to human error, and can delay necessary treatment. As the volume of medical imaging data continues to grow, there is a significant need for automated systems to assist in early detection and diagnosis.
### Project Overview 
This project aims to develop an automated brain tumor detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image analysis tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features. The CNN architecture is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation by utilizing multiple building blocks, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model starts by applying various convolutional filters to the input MRI images to extract low-level features like edges and textures, then progresses to higher-level features that may represent more complex structures such as tumors.

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images that have been carefully labeled as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free. These images undergo a series of preprocessing steps, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to enhance the quality and variability of the training data, which helps the model generalize better to new, unseen images. During training, the CNN adjusts its filters and weights through numerous iterations to minimize the classification error, learning to distinguish between subtle differences in MRI scans that indicate the presence of a tumor.

Additionally, advanced techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are employed to prevent overfitting and ensure robust learning. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it can reliably identify tumors in diverse clinical scenarios. This deep learning-based approach leverages the power of CNNs to process and analyze medical images efficiently, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and significantly reducing the time required for analysis, ultimately improving patient outcomes by providing timely and reliable assistance to radiologists.
